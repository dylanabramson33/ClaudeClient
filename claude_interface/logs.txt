Query: django app urls is having issue accessing urls in application folder
Response: If you're having issues accessing URLs in your Django application folder, there could be several reasons for this. Let's go through some common problems and their solutions:

1. Make sure your app is included in INSTALLED_APPS:
   In your project's settings.py file, ensure that your app is listed in the INSTALLED_APPS list:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'your_app_name',
       ...
   ]
   ```

2. Check if your app's urls.py is properly configured:
   In your app's urls.py file, make sure you have defined your URL patterns correctly:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('example/', views.example_view, name='example'),
       # Add more URL patterns here
   ]
   ```

3. Include your app's URLs in the project's main urls.py:
   In your project's main urls.py file, include your app's URLs:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('your_app/', include('your_app.urls')),
   ]
   ```

4. Check for naming conflicts:
   Ensure that there are no naming conflicts between your app's URLs and other apps' URLs.

5. Verify your views are correctly defined:
   Make sure the views referenced in your urls.py file are properly defined in your views.py file.

6. Check for typos:
   Double-check for any typos in your URL patterns, view names, or import statements.

7. Use the correct URL structure:
   When accessing your URLs, make sure you're using the correct structure. For example, if you've included your app's URLs under 'your_app/', you need to access them like: http://yourdomain.com/your_app/example/

8. Restart your development server:
   Sometimes, changes to URL configurations may not be reflected immediately. Try stopping and restarting your development server.

9. Check for circular imports:
   Ensure that there are no circular imports between your urls.py and views.py files.

10. Use Django's debug toolbar:
    Install and configure Django Debug Toolbar to get more information about your URLs and request/response cycle.

If you're still having issues after checking these points, please provide more specific information about the error you're encountering, including any error messages and relevant code snippets from your urls.py and views.py files.
